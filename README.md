# Movie-App-Practice

This is a project that I am still learning from. I'm especially learning from the javascript. This project is also helping me learn more about APIs. This project was a lot of fun for me to learn from since this looks more like an app I would use everyday (ex. Netflix, Plex, etc...). I'm still working on understanding how everything ties into each other in this practice lesson, but I really enjoyed it so I figured I'd add it here for me to reference in the future.
